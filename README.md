# Teams API server

## Overview

This is a simple RESTful API server for handling queries and request for football teams.

This app consists of an `express` api server, a controller to handle the route methods, a model to provide the `Team` object interface and `Teams` to read and write the data from the file system. The `TypeScript` files are in `src/` and tests are in the `src/tests`.

The language used is `TypseScript` on top of `NodeJs`, with `express` framework for the server and `jest` framework for testing.
  
To run the server, run this command `npm start`, and to run the tests use this command `npm test`.  You can access the server using this url `http://localhost:3000`.
